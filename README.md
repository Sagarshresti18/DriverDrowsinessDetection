# DriverDrowsinessDetection
This Python project detects driver drowsiness in real time using eye aspect ratio (EAR) from facial landmarks. If eyes stay closed beyond a threshold, it triggers an alert sound. Built with OpenCV, dlib, and pygame, it enhances road safety by monitoring driver alertness via webcam.
